------------------ PyGSTi offline support files.  --------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the files needed to display offline HTML
content (i.e. that which does not require an internet connection)
generated by the PyGSTi Python package.

For things to work correctly, this "offline" directory must be
placed in the same parent directory as the pyGSTi-generated report
HTML files (or a symbolic link is usually fine too - depending on
your browser security settings).  Do not rename the folder, as the
HTML files assume that resources are located under "offline".
